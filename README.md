# Data structures and algorithms project I

This is a project I did for a university project in data structures and algorithms. 
The solution implements file record management with linked lists.

## Operations implemented are:
<ul>
  <li>deletion</li>
  <li>searching</li>
  <li>add</li>
  <li>sort</li>
</ul>

## Running the program
clone this repo to your machine then open terminal and run:

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>g++ -o main main.cpp List.cpp LinkedList.cpp Student.cpp Course.cpp</code>
  </li>
</ul>

this will result in with an out put "main" which an binary executable.
execute it using:

<ul>
  <li><code>./main</code> if you are running linux</li>
  <li><code>.\main</code> if you are on windows</li>
</ul>
